### Professional Projects

Here's a [link](https://github.com/ryanmwhitephd/artemis) to the Artemis project, a streaming-data analytics platform built off Apahche's new Arrow data format. This project serves as a proof-of-concept for the Arrow data format, and illustrates the flexibility of this format.
